        "## What Is Deep Learning?\n",
        "\n",
        "* A type of machine learning based on artificial neural networks in which multiple layers or processing are used to extract progressively higher level features from data. \n",
        "* Machine learning is turning things (data) into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers. The computer does this part through code and math.\n",
        "* Deep learning is usually considered a subfield of machine learning. Both machine learning and deep learning fall under the umbrella of artificial intelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this course is to get deep into the programming element of deep learning using the `TensorFlow` library.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Use Machine Learning/Deep Learning?\n",
        "\n",
        "* The good reason is: why not? Both are extremely powerful tools.\n",
        "* The better reason: For a complex problem, such as teaching a car how to self-drive, can you think of all the rules? Probably not, since there are so many of them and many of the rules are learned through driving itself.\n",
        "* Machine learning and deep learning are very flexible and can be used to solve a huge different variety of problems.\n",
        "* You should not use ML/DL if you can build a simple rule-based system that doesn't require machine learning, do that. This comes from Google's ML Handbook.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Is DL Good For?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Problems with long lists of rules - when the traditional approach fails, use ML/DL.\n",
        "* Continually changing environments - deep learning can adapt (learn) to new scenarios.\n",
        "* Discovering insights within large collections of data - can you imagine trying to hand-craft rules for what 101 different kinds of food look like?\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Is DL (Typically) Not Good For?\n",
        "\n",
        "* When you need explainability - the patterns learned by a deep learning models are typically uninterpretable by a human.\n",
        "* When the traditional approach is a better problem.\n",
        "* When errors are unnacceptable - since the outputs of deep learning model aren't always predictable. \n",
        "* When you don't have much data - DL models usually require a fairly large amount of data to produce great results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ML vs DL\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional machine learning algorithms typically perform well on structured data, with rows and columns. Think of a typically dataset on an excel sheet. Deep learning performs well on unstructured data, such as natural language text or sound waves. \n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the most common algorithms for ML are: random forest, naive bayes, nearest neighbor, and SVM. These can be referred to as \"shallow algorithms.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the most common algorithms for DL are: neural networks, fully connected neural network, CNN, RNN, transformer, and others. For this course, we are going to be focused on building NNs, fully connected NNs, CNNs, and RNNs. \n",
        "\n",
        "You can use ML and DL for structured/unstructured data; it just depends on how you formulate the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Are Neural Networks?\n",
        "\n",
        "* They are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.\n",
        "* These NNs are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. \n",
        "* If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed to the next layer of the network. \n",
        "* Input of the NN must be numeric and we typically set the output as something that a human can understand. For example, we can have a probability output with anything above 0.5 as an event happening and less than or equal to 0.5 as an event not happening. \n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, the neural networks takes inputs, converts them to numerical values (numerical encoding), learngs representation (patterns, features, and weights), creates representation outputs (numeric values, such as probabilities), and then converts them to human understandable outputs (such as an event happening or not). \n",
        "\n",
        "As you can see, there is an input later (data goes in there), hidden layers (learns patterns in the data), and an output layer (outputs learned representation or predicted probabilities). \n",
        "\n",
        "As a note, patterns in data is an arbitrary term, you will also hear embedding, weights, feature representation, and feature vectors. This all refer to similar things.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Supervised Learning - we have data and the output labels.\n",
        "* Semi-supervised Learning - we have data and it only has some labels.\n",
        "* Unsupervised Learning - we have data and no output labels.\n",
        "* Transfer learning - taking what one DL model has learned on a set of data and using it on another problem from another set of data. \n",
